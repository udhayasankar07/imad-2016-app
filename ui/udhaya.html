                The Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime has been launched in India at a price of Rs. 18,790 and is now available at various retail stores. It has a lot of features such as a metal body, large 3300mAh battery, S Power Planning, and superb screen. S Power Planning and Secure Folder are both neat value additions in software. Despite featuring a large 5.5-inch screen, the J7 Prime is easy to manage. At this price point, the phone is pleasure to use.

                   The new Samsung J-series handset will easily compete with current favourites such as the Motorola Moto X Play and Lenovo Vibe X3. The Galaxy J7 Prime however faces its biggest challenge with the launch of the Lenovo Z2 Plus which packs a flagship-grade Snapdragon 820 processor and starts at a price of Rs. 17,999.
